# Final Solution: Using html2canvas-pro for OKLCH Support

## 🎯 The Real Solution

Based on [GitHub Issue #3150](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/issues/3150), the proper fix is to use **html2canvas-pro** which has native support for modern CSS color functions including `oklch()`.

## ❌ Previous Approaches (Didn't Work)

### Attempt 1: Replace oklch in inline styles only

-   **Problem**: Didn't handle oklch from CSS classes

### Attempt 2: Remove CSS and copy computed styles

-   **Problem**: Too complex, performance issues, still had errors

### Attempt 3: Various workarounds

-   **Problem**: Hacky, unreliable, maintenance nightmare

## ✅ The Right Solution

### Use html2canvas-pro v1.5.8+

From the GitHub discussion, the maintainers confirmed that **html2canvas-pro** supports oklch colors natively.

## 🔧 Implementation Steps

### 1. Uninstall html2canvas

```bash
npm uninstall html2canvas
```

### 2. Install html2canvas-pro

```bash
npm install html2canvas-pro@^1.5.8
```

Latest version available: `1.5.12` (as of Oct 2025)

### 3. Update Import

```typescript
// Before
import html2canvas from "html2canvas";

// After
import html2canvas from "html2canvas-pro";
```

### 4. Simplify Code (Remove Workarounds)

```typescript
// Simple, clean configuration - no workarounds needed!
const canvas = await html2canvas(slideElement, {
    scale: 2,
    backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
    logging: false,
    useCORS: true,
    allowTaint: true,
    imageTimeout: 15000,
});
```

**No need for:**

-   ❌ `onclone` callbacks
-   ❌ CSS removal
-   ❌ Style copying
-   ❌ Color conversion
-   ❌ Complex workarounds
